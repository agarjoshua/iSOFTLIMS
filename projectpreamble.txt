Differentiation:

Roles focus on permissions and access control.
User types focus on categorizing users based on their inherent characteristics or responsibilities.
Roles are often linked to Django's permission system for authorization.
User types may involve additional fields in the user model or the use of a custom user model to store specific attributes associated with each type.

You could have a "Role" of "Admin" with permissions to manage all aspects of the system.
You could have a "User Type" of "Administrator" with additional attributes like "Department" or "Responsibility."
